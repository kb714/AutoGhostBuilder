# AutoGhostBuilder

Automatically build ghost entities by hovering over them or clicking on them. Perfect for early game before you have construction bots.

## What it does

When enabled, AutoGhostBuilder automatically constructs ghosts when you have the required items in your inventory. No more manual clicking on each ghost!

## How to use

1. **Toggle the mod** with `Ctrl+G` or click the ghost icon in your shortcut bar
2. **Cycle through modes:**
   - **Hover Mode** - Builds ghosts automatically when you hover over them
   - **Click Mode** - Only builds when you click on a ghost (prevents accidental building)
   - **Disabled** - Mod is off

3. **Build ghosts** by either hovering or clicking (depending on your mode)

## Features

- **Three building modes** to fit your playstyle
- **Upgrade planner support** - automatically inserts modules when building
- **Quality matching** - respects quality requirements on ghosts
- **Safe item handling** - never consumes items with metadata
- **Smart feedback** - shows which items are missing or if ghosts are out of range
